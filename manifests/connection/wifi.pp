# == Parameters
#
# [*ifname*]
#   Name of the wireless LAN interface. Defaults to 'wlan0'.
# [*ssid*]
#   The SSID of the Access Point to connect to. Defaults to $title.

    # Add the connection. This is brutal but works. Later on this should be 
    # converted into a real Puppet type. Alternatively the entire connection 
    # file should be made a template and filled in by Puppet.
