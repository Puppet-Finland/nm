# nm

A Puppet module for managing Network manager. Supports configuring Wifi 
connections on recent Network Manager versions.

# Facts

This module adds some custom facts:

* $::nm_version: Version number of nmcli.
* $::nm_can_add_connection: "True" if nmcli supports adding connections, "False" otherwise.
* $::nm_connections: a comma-separated string that lists all system connections. On RedHat systems this fact shows all connections instead of only those that were generated by NetworkManager.

# Module usage

* [Class: nm](manifests/init.pp)
* [Define: nm::connection::wifi](manifests/connection/wifi.pp)

# Dependencies

This module depends on ruby-versionomy, which is automatically installed only 
for Debian derivatives, where it can be trivially installed from the 
distribution's standard repositories. See [metadata.json](metadata.json) for 
details.

# Operating system support

This module has been tested on

* Debian 8
* Fedora 21

It should work on any Linux that has relatively recent version of nmcli. For 
details see [params.pp](manifests/params.pp).
